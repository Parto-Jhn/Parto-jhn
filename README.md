#  Parto | Computational Designer turned Data Explorer  
*Designing systems, not just structures.*

Hi there! I’m Parto—a designer, builder, and data thinker.  
With roots in architecture, robotics, and structural engineering, I specialize in **design automation**, **parametric modeling**, and **data-driven workflows** that empower innovation across disciplines.

I currently work on **digital strategy and transformation**, using my background in computational design to improve systems and workflows. On the side, I practice **data analytics**—solving real-world problems with a mix of creativity, logic, and code.

## 🧰 I love
`Python` • `SQL` • `C++` • `Grasshopper` • `Rhino.Inside` • `Git` • `Power BI` •  
Still love visual programming, but fluent in data and automation too.

📊 Data & Analytics

Python – analytics, automation, / basics of machine learning, scripting
SQL – querying, data wrangling, dashboards
GHPython – scripting inside Grasshopper for geometry + data workflows

💻 Software & Backend

C++ – performance-heavy tasks, geometry processing, engineering applications

🌐 Web & Scripting

JavaScript – basic scripting and web interactivity
HTML/CSS – layout and styling for web interfaces

🎛️ Visual Programming

Grasshopper (Rhino) – parametric modeling, automation
Dynamo (Revit) – computational BIM and automation workflows

## 📚 Currently learning
- **Deepening my machine learning skills** (beyond fundamentals)
- **Bridging business and data science** for strategic impact
- **Real-time data dashboards** and storytelling with data
- **Cloud-based workflows** and deployment

## 🚀 Next steps
- Strengthen roots in **data science** and **applied ML**
- Work on projects that **connect data insights with business decisions**
- Keep exploring roles at the intersection of **technology, strategy, and analytics**

  
## ✨ Fun Fact
I’ve spent **3 years designing and building robots from scratch**—PCBs, sensors, hardware, firmware—you name it.  
And just to keep things interesting, I also hold **advanced fashion design certificates** 👗🤖  
*Yes, I’ve stitched both code and fabric!*


## 🌍 Location
Based in Sweden 🇸🇪 | Working across disciplines and domains
